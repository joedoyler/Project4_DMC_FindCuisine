# Find Cuisine

Find Cuisine is a directory of recipes made by its users for its users. The aim is to bring a restaurant experience into the households via the sharing of different some of the best meals are users have ever made. 
The user is provided with all the facilities to set themselves up and including visual aids to go along with their recipes to entice users on what they could be making with images of mouth watering meals.

# UX

## How To Navigate
To ensure the navigation process is as simple as possible the user is greeted with one block of text on the home page. It oulines that they need to register to create their recipes. The add recipes section is also hidden until the registration process has been completed to ensure no confusion is experienced when first viewing the website.

Everything else is displayed as a form, something universal to all users to ensure that people aren't confused. Additional button features are kept to a minimum so virtually anyone can navigate the website.

## Clicks To Create
The nav bar at the top of each page ensures that there are a limited amount of clicks on each page to get the user to start create and checking out recipes as soon as possible. 

Once the user is registered they can get straight to the add recipes section in one click as it is located in the nav bar once they are set up.

## User Ambitions
The user group for Find Cuisine is anyone with basic computer skills simply looking to find and share recipes in order to: 

* try something new
* navigate a simple interface to find recipes
* produce content and share with others
* be apart of something bigger than themselves

These ambitions are achieved through Find Cuisine: 

* Having recipes being dispayed from people all over the world that are sharing their own unique perspectives and ingredients
* Having an easy to use interface with mininmal text and buttons so the user isn't lost on where to go
* Featuring an Add Recipe page for registered users. Displayed in a simple form format making it as easy as a few clicks
* Being able to store registration/log in details the user feels apart of a group of people all coming together to share and experience eachothers favourite foods 

## User Stories

As a general user who looks up/ shares recipes on the internet, I want to:

 * See where my created recipes go
 * Have quick access to all the recipes on the site
 * Have reassuring messages flashed on screen to ensure I am doing the right thing on the website
 * Create my own recipes
 * Navigate the website without fear of being confused
 * Have the ability to edit / delete recipes in case I make a mistake or want to take my recipe down 


# features

## Registration
Upon clicking on to the website the user can register their soon to be log in details and create their own unique username which is then stored on a database with a hash security protection on their password in order to protect their details. 

No two users can have the same username making sure that each user is unique on the website.

## Log In
Once registered the user can come back to the web page time and time again and log back in using their registered details. The database indefinitely stores username and password meaning a user can come back at any time and access their recipes and continue on creating them for years to come. 

## Add Recipe
Users can create their own recipes via the Add Recipe page. Different sections of the form ensure that the user must enter details into a given section of the form to make sure no false/half empty recipes are flooded on to the website

## Recipe Directory
The recipes page contains all newly created recipes and dispays them all on to one page for users to see. Each user is responsible for editing and deleting recipes and won't be able to effect anyone elses recipes bar their own. 

## Visual Image Input On User Recipes
In the image link section of the the Add Recipe form the user can input an image link of their meal and will have it displayed on top of their recipe. This creates both a personal element and aids with visual information as to what exactly a user should expect the meal to look like.  

# Colour Scheme 

## Fancy / Posh Theme
Upon researching for the general restaurant/ aristocrat vibe three very distinct colours came to mind which can be seen throughout the entire project which are:

* Black
* White
* Light & Dark variations of red

# Features Left To Implement

## Profile Page With Users Recipes Kept Separate

As it stands the users profile page is a rather blank html page that simply displays the users username. 

Given more time I would add it in that on the users profile page their is a section that displays the users recipes and not anyone elses. Currently the user will have to sive through all the other recipes to check on their own. 


# Technologies Used

 * HTML, CSS and JQuery were the programming languages used in the coding of this project.
 * For scaling Bootstrap CDN was used to add a more responsive website.
 * MongoDB used as the database to store all of the recipe details, user information and categories of food.
 * Gitpod used to deploy the project alongside Heroku.
 * Jinja used for templating with Flask in the HTML pages. Makes for a much simpler link from backend to frontend. 
 * Flask used as a python framework.
 * Font Awesome used for icons displayed throughout the website pages.
 
# Testing 

### As a general user who plays games on the internet, See where my created recipes go

All newly created recipes by any users are all added to the recipes page where it acts as a directory where anyone can search for their recipes and other users recipes that they have created on the website.

### As a general user I want to have reassuring messages flashed on screen to ensure I am doing the right thing on the website

As the user registers, logs in and adds recipes to website they are flashed reassuring messages to say that they have completed that step successfully provided all details entered in are correct. 

### As a general user I want to create my own recipes

This can be completed via the add recipes page. Once the user has entered all their details and submitted an image link they can simply click on the Add Recipe button and instantly their recipe gets added to the recipe page to be viewed by all.

### As a general user I want to have the ability to edit / delete recipes in case I make a mistake or want to take my recipe down

The user can simply click on the recipes page and have two very clear buttons displayed on their recipe where they can choose to either edit or delete. 

On clicking delete the recipe will be wiped from the database and no longer be available. 

On clicking edit the user is taken to an edit recipe page where they can edit recipes where the recipe details will be displayed ready for them to edit and change. 

### As a general user I want to navigate the website without fear of being confused

The layout of the website was made specifically so there are a minimal amount of clicks to navigate with a minimal amount of buttons to click to progress through a given task.

# Validators

# Version Control

## Gitpod 
Gitpod was chosen for the version control of the project from the very beginning. 

## GitHub

GitHub was used as a repository for everything pushed from Gitpod.

# Deployment

## Gitpod 

The entire project has been coded on Gitpod starting from the first commit. It allows for the sharing of running workspaces making tutor/mentor sessions run smoother.

In order to commit and push to GitHub:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Insert commit Message Here"
    git push 

After each main section of the project was completed a commit and push was used to ensure proper tracking and proper commit etiquette was used throughout. This also prevents the entire project being lossed due to unforeseen circumstances such as server crashes / late night server updates.

GitHub Pages was used to deploy the site. Upon selecting a name for the project, "Settings" was selected. Then proceeded to the "GitHub Pages" section where the "Source" was switched to "Master branch". At the top of the page a link is then found to the deployed website where it is submitted during the project submission section for grading.

## Heroku 

To deploy my project to Heroku the following steps were followed:

* Go to the "settings" page in heroku app
* To set up heroku config vars from Gitpod to Heroku, scroll down  and click on "Reveal Config Vars" section:
* Type in "IP" to KEY and "0.0.0.0" to value 
* Type in "PORT" to KEY and "5000" to value 
* Type in "MONGO_URI" to KEY and "mongodb+srv://joeDoyler:<password>@myfirstcluster-y6kfn.mongodb.net/recipe_database?retryWrites=true&w=majority" to value 
* Type in "SECRET_KEY" to KEY and "<secret_key>" to value

# Credits 

## Content & Acknowledgements

A massive influence for this project came directly from the course content available to students. The Task Manager project had many logical similarities to fulfilling the needs of the project itself with some features missing from it such as the visual aid of having the image added to the recipe section. 

The styling for the index page is influenced by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM27kA5M3vo video on creating a restaurant page.

Furthermore, on several issues interacted with on the project a massive support came from multiple tutors.
